/**
 * Persistent history of applied pipeline snapshots, one entry per
 * dynasty/team/season. Lives in userData (same place as
 * pipeline-tool-settings.json), NOT inside the dynasty save file itself,
 * and NOT next to the app -- so it survives app updates/reinstalls and
 * isn't tied to any one save file's folder location.
 *
 * Structure (current):
 * {
 *   "<dynastyCode>": {
 *     "Bowling Green": {
 *       "2026": { "Ohio": { "tier": "HouseholdName", "value": 220 }, ... },
 *       "2027": { ... }
 *     },
 *     "Toledo": { ... }
 *   },
 *   "<other-dynasty-code>": { ... }
 * }
 *
 * Older entries (recorded before value tracking was added back) are a
 * flat { region: tierString } object instead -- readers need to check
 * whether a region's entry is a string or an object to tell the two
 * formats apart. Those older seasons simply have no score to show;
 * nothing needs to be migrated. (A separate, now-scrapped experiment
 * also tried tracking coaching staff per season under a {tiers, coaches}
 * wrapper -- if any entries got written in that shape, they're harmless
 * leftovers; nothing reads or writes that shape anymore.)
 *
 * Re-applying the same team in the same season overwrites that season's
 * entry rather than duplicating it -- history is always "the last Apply
 * for this team, this season," matching how the tool is actually used
 * (you might re-run and re-apply a few times while testing settings
 * before landing on final numbers for that preseason).
