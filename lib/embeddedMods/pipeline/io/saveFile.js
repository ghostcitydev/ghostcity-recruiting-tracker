/**
 * Direct save-file read/write, using madden-franchise. Replaces the entire
 * xlsx export/import workflow -- no Franchise Editor exports needed at all.
 *
 * Tables are looked up by UNIQUE ID, never by name and never by numeric
 * table ID. Name-based lookup is unreliable in this schema (proved early
 * in this project -- Team in particular only found 9/143 records by name,
 * but all 143 by ID). Numeric table ID is NOT safe either, on advice from
 * the CFB27 modding community: that number is assigned per game build and
 * can shift on a patch, which would make getTableById() silently return
 * the WRONG table after an update -- not an error, just quietly wrong
 * data, which is a much worse failure mode than a crash since it could
 * write garbage into someone's save. Unique ID (found in a table's
 * header, distinct from its table ID) is the community-recommended
 * stable identifier and is what every lookup below actually uses.
 *
 * Confirmed against a real save (2026-07 build) -- both values shown for
 * reference, but only uniqueId is actually used for lookups below:
 *   Team                       -> tableId 6334,  uniqueId 3359508968
 *   SchoolPipelineInfluence[]  -> tableId 5919,  uniqueId 3284177001
 *   SchoolPipelineInfluence    -> tableId 4306,  uniqueId 4261714800
 *   Player                     -> tableId 4244,  uniqueId 1612938518
 *   Coach                      -> tableId 4173,  uniqueId 1860529246
 *   Franchise                  -> tableId 4553,  uniqueId 2226370608
 *   SeasonInfo                 -> tableId 4141,  uniqueId 3123991521
 * If a future game update ever changes the underlying schema enough that
 * these uniqueIds themselves stop resolving, getTableByUniqueId() throws
 * rather than silently returning something wrong -- a loud, obvious
 * failure instead of quiet data corruption.
 *
 * SAFETY: writeUpdatedSave() NEVER modifies your original save file. It
 * always works on a copy, and the original path you opened is never
 * touched, no matter what.

  //   1. CROSS-TEAM COLLISIONS -- the same row genuinely, structurally
  //      referenced by two different teams' real slots at once (or twice
  //      by the same team through two different slot fields). Left
  //      unfixed, this causes a "didn't match after writing" verification
  //      failure the moment Apply tries to write both teams' different
  //      content to the same physical row.
  //   2. WITHIN-TEAM HOLES -- a team's own slot list has an invalid
  //      (null, or pointing at the wrong table) slot with a REAL slot
  //      still sitting somewhere after it. readTeamPipelineMapping only
  //      ever sees the contiguous prefix up to the first invalid slot,
  //      so any real data past a hole is invisible to every other part
  //      of this tool -- and is exactly the shape of null-reference
  //      damage confirmed to have caused real, reproducible crashes.
  //
  // Both get fixed the same simple way: give the affected slot a genuine,
  // uniquely-owned orphan row instead of whatever invalid/duplicate thing
  // it currently points at. No shared placeholder row, no change to how
  // shrink or expand behave -- this only cleans up rows that were already

 * TeamSlots is a reference into a separate slot-array record -- same
 * shape as Team.Roster, just decoded through the manual 32-bit reference
 * string instead of the schema's .isReference/.referenceData API (which
 * doesn't expose this particular field the normal way -- not a stylistic
 * choice, this was the part that actually took real work to figure out
 * in the sibling tool, so it's kept as-is rather than "improved" blind).
 *
 * IMPORTANT: resolveSlotArray below returns Team table ROW POSITIONS, not
 * Team.TeamIndex. Every other function in this file keys teams by
 * Team.TeamIndex (the field) -- confirmed on a real save that these two
 * numbers can genuinely differ for the same team. getConferenceMembers()
 * converts row -> Team.TeamIndex right before returning, specifically so
 * nothing downstream of this function ever has to think about row
 * position at all -- the exact class of bug that caused a real,
 * confirmed cross-keying issue in readPlayers() earlier this project.
 *
 * @returns {Array<{ name: string, memberTeamIndexes: number[] }>}
